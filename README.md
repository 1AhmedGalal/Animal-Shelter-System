# Animal-Shelter-System

A console application written in C++ as a project for the ASU's structured programming course. The system  allows the users to report homeless animals that need help as well as searching for an animal to adopt and donating to the shelter. The system will be able to categorize the animals based on their type, health situation and location. When a user reports an animal, it has to be confirmed by an admin of the shelter to make sure itâ€™s not a spam.
